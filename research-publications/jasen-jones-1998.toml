description = "First published 1998. Reprint edition: Routledge, 2005. From publisher’s description: “a classic work on a little-studied subject in American music history: the contribution of African-American songwriters to the world of popular song. Hailed by Publishers Weekly as ‘thoroughly researched and entertainingly written,’ this work documents the careers of songwriters like James A. Bland (‘Carry Me Back to Ole Virginny’), Bert Williams (‘Nobody’), W. C. Handy (‘St. Louis Blues’), Noble Sissle, Eubie Blake (‘I'm Just Wild About Harry’), and many more. Richly illustrated with rare photographs from sheet music, newspapers, and other unique sources, the book documents an entire era of performance when black singers, dancers, and actors were active on the New York stage.”"
