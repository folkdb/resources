title = "Ragtime"
description = "Sheet music of popular Ragtime compositions, mostly from 1900 to 1920. Ragtime was a predecessor to the stride piano and hot jazz of the 1920s and the Swing music of the 30s. Country fiddlers and blues guitar players of the 20s and 30s were also influenced by Ragtime rhythms and chord progressions. As the collection also shows, because this musical trend fed off of the popularity of turn-of-the-century “Coon” songs, Ragtime sheet music was often promoted with derogatory and grotesque images of African-Americans, which were sometimes used as cover designs even for purely instrumental piano compositions."
