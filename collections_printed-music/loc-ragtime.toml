title = "Ragtime"
description = "Sheet music of popular Ragtime compositions, mostly from 1900 to 1920. Ragtime was a predecessor to the stride piano and hot jazz of the 1920s and the Swing music of the 30s. Blues guitar players of the 20s and 30s were also influenced by Ragtime rhythms and chord progressions. Because this musical trend fed off of the popularity of turn-of-the-century “Coon” songs, Ragtime sheet music was often promoted with derogatory and grotesque images of African-Americans, which were used even as cover designs for piano compositions with no lyrics."
