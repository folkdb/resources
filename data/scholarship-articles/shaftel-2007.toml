description = "Music & Politics 1, no. 2 (2007). Argues that Stephen Foster’s later songs “reflect a growing uneasiness with [his] earlier style” of minstrel caricature, leading him to “use musical strategies found in the ballads and focus on nostalgic themes, thus attempting to humanize the image of the oppressed slave.” In addition to analyzing the lyrics of the songs, the author employs an analysis of tonal and rhythmic structure to make this argument."
