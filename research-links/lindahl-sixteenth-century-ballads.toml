title = "Sixteenth Century Ballads: A work in progress"
description = "As described: \"Much attention is paid to post-1600 ballads, both traditional and broadsides, but only a few sixteenth century ballads are known. Of the ones which are known, most are not printed with the lyrics and tunes together, so are not very accessible to the casual reader. The goal of this project is to produce a collection of 'interesting' ballads from before 1600, containing sheet music and lyrics, both in their original form, and in a form intelligible to a modern listener.\""
