title = "African-American Band Music & Recordings, 1883 to 1923"
description = "As described: “The core of this presentation consists of ‘stock’ arrangements for bands or small orchestras of popular songs written by African Americans. In addition, we offer a smaller selection of historic sound recordings illustrating these songs and many others by the same composers (the arrangements might not necessarily be the same as those on the stocks). Educational materials include short biographies of composers and performers of the time and historical essays.”"
