title = "Folk-Songs of America: The Robert Winslow Gordon Collection, 1922-1932"
description = "As described: “The recordings on this album represent one man's ambitious attempt to document the extent and variety of American folksong. . . . Gordon carried his heavy cylinder recorder (and later, his disc machine) to the San Francisco waterfront, the Appalachian Mountains, and the Georgia coast in order to record the diverse singing traditions of this country. He recorded nearly a thousand cylinders, collected nearly ten thousand more song texts from the readers of his popular articles, and gathered many thousand additional song versions from old camp-meeting and revival songbooks, broadsides, folios, and hillbilly recordings — ephemeral material of which few of his colleagues were aware. . . . [I]n his theoretical orientation, his scientific outlook, his dedication to technical accuracy, and his interest in phonographic and photographic documentation, Gordon was a pioneer among the folklorists of the 1920s and 1930s.”"
