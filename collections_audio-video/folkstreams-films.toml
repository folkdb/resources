description = "As described: “The films on Folkstreams were produced by independent filmmakers. These documentaries focus on the culture, struggles, and arts of unnoticed Americans from many different kinds of communities. The filmmakers were driven more by sheer engagement with the people and their traditions than by commercial hopes. . . . The mission of Folkstreams is to preserve these films and their records of these worlds and make them available to the widest possible audience.” Several films feature 20th century folk and blues musicians from various regions in North America, including Southern Appalachia."
