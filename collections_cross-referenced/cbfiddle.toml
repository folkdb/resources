title = "Cape Breton Fiddle Recording Index"
description = "As described: “This web site contains a comprehensive index of commerical recordings of Cape Breton fiddle tunes. Use this site to identify the tunes contained on a recording, and to locate recordings on which a tune is played. . . . In this index, unlike many tune indexes on the web, I have attempted to identify tunes, not just tune titles, so that different recordings of the same tune are linked together, even where different titles are used. Determining whether two recordings are recordings of the same tune is inherently subjective, and errors (primarily of omission) are likely. Although the results cannot be considered definitive, they are (hopefully) useful.” This is a nicely designed modern website with obvious navigation, advanced search capability, and fast loading query results. It currently indexes 372 recorded albums/compilations and 5384 distinct tunes."
