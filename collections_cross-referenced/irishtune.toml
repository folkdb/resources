title = "Irish Traditional Music Tune Index"
description = "As described: “The guiding educational mission of irishtune.info is to promote aural learning of Irish traditional music using recordings of historically important musicians within the tradition. It achieves this mission by revealing to visitors exactly where a particular tune can be found on commercially available recordings. Because that achievement requires solving the problem of musically identifying the tunes on each recorded source despite the lack of standard tune titles in Irish music, the secondary mission of irishtune.info is to establish the identities of Irish traditional dance tunes in a way useful for the global community of scholarship on this subject.” The index is generated from 873 recorded albums/compilations and 60 tune books. One of the best features of this site is the ability to listen to short snippets of actual recordings and to see the corresponding notation. This is one of many technically advanced features that are implemented."
