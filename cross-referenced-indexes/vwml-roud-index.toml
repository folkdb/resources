title = "Roud Folk Song Index"
description = "The main purpose of the Roud Index is to group together song variants that likely spring from a common source and to assign a unique identifier to each grouping. In this way, the Roud Index can be seen as an extension of Francis James Child’s project to construct a comprehensive classification of traditional English-language ballads from extant sources. Whereas Child's life work resulted in 305 numbered ballads, the Roud Index is reported to include 25,000 songs drawn from 18th and 19th century broadsides, popular sheet music and song books, pre-WWII commercial recordings, and the field recordings of folk collectors. English, Scottish, Irish, and American songs (including African-American blues and spirituals) are well represented. The index can be searched from the main page of the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library’s website. Most records contain only citations, but some results also link to digitized source materials. The search interface is not the most user-friendly and can sometimes be slow to return results (from a US East Coast location)."
