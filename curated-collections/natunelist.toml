description = "As described: \"This site is a somewhat random reference source for mostly traditional dance and fiddle tunes from several regions around the North Atlantic: Scandinavia, the British Isles, Quebec, Cape Breton, MÃ©tis (Saskatchewan & Manitoba), New England, Appalachia, and more. It is intended as a resource for musicians wanting to learn a tune or remember how particular tunes are played.\" ABC notation is provided for many of the tunes, along with low-resolution images of the sheet music. Tune entries include streaming audio and embedded YouTube videos featuring both amateur and professional performers, including some simplified and slowed-down versions for learning purposes."
