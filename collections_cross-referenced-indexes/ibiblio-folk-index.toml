title = "Folk Music Index"
description = "Large searchable index developed by cross-referencing song titles, artists/performers, and composer credits from a database of nearly 5000 audio releases (LPs, CDs, cassettes, and 45-RPM singles) and more than 500 printed sources (books, magazines, sheet music, folios). The database was methodically compiled by a teacher/performer of traditional music who also had a career as a library professional during the first decade of the World Wide Web. Recorded sources were collected beginning in the 1970s, incorporating new compilation releases and recordings by contemporary artists up to 2013. Although the site design looks dated, the index is easy to browse or search, and query results load quickly."
