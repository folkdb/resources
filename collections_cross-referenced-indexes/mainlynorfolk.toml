title = "Mainly Norfolk: English Folk and Other Good Music"
description = "Large index cross-referencing recordings by British folk-revival performers with major folk song catalogs, including the Roud Index, Child Ballads, and others. Song entries list artists who recorded the song in chronological order with the track title, album title, record label, and recording date for each, often including commentary from the liner notes and comparative lyrics. Many entries include embedded YouTube videos of more recent live performances. Some songs of North American origin are included, but most of the performers indexed are those who have recorded on UK folk labels. The site also features comprehensive discographies of significant artists in the English/Scottish folk revivals."
