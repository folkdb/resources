title = "Pierre Cruzatte : Tunes"
description = "Lists the names of tunes that were played by a fiddler who accompanied the Lewis and Clark expedition from 1804 to 1806. As explained: “Pierre Cruzatte, a member of the permanent party of the Lewis and Clark expedition, was an expert riverman recruited for his navigational skills and his command of the French and Omaha languages. . . . Cruzatte played the fiddle ‘extreemly well’ according to Lewis on June 25, 1805. Cruzatte’s music served not only as recreation for the members of the expedition but also as a critical diplomatic tool: he played — and the men danced and sang — for many of the Indian nations which the expedition met along the way. The journals of the expedition describe him playing numerous times, and he probably played many more times than the journalists recorded.”"
